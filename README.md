# Raspberry Pi Synth
A software/hardware synthesizer built on the Raspberry Pi. This project aims to provide a simple, low-latency synthesizer environment that can be used for learning audio programming, making music, or experimenting with embedded system audio development.

## Overview
This software synthesizer is designed to run on embedded Linux, specifically on the Raspberry Pi. It leverages the [Lightweight Embedded Audio Framework (LEAF)](https://github.com/spiricom/LEAF) for digital signal processing (DSP), allowing it to generate various waveforms and apply effects. A dedicated Synth API layer sits on top of LEAF to fully utilize its capabilities. MIDI input is captured via ALSA, which in turn updates and triggers the synthesizerâ€™s sound generation. Audio output is handled by PortAudio, sending processed samples to the audio buffer for playback.

## Features

### Implemented
- Polyphonic sine oscillators, preloaded for immediate playback.
- MIDI input handling for real-time note triggering.
- Synth API for managing oscillator voices.
- Low-latency performance using ALSA for MIDI.
- Audio samples routed out through PortAudio.

### Planned
- Additional oscillator waveforms (square, saw, triangle, etc.).
- Expanded effects (reverb, delay) and adjustable effect parameters.
- Support for effect chains and more advanced DSP modules.
- MIDI clip recording and playback functionality.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 2 or higher (Raspberry Pi 4 recommended for best performance).
- SD card with at least 32 GB capacity (larger recommended if storing samples or MIDI clips).
- USB Midi Controller.
- Further hardware details (optional DACs, etc.) to be added.

## Software

- [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page) for MIDI input.
- [PortAudio](https://www.portaudio.com/) for audio output.
- Build tools (e.g., make, cmake) as needed.

## Usage & Configuration
Information regarding setup, command-line arguments, configuration files, and runtime parameters will be provided in a future update.
